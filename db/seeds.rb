This approach can be slow for large tables, as it requires the database to sort all of the records before selecting the first one. However, it may be more precise if you want a truly random record, as it ensures that all records have an equal chance of being selected. The second method you found involves generating a random ID and then selecting the first record with an ID greater than or equal to that random ID. This approach is faster, as it only needs to look up a single record based on its ID. However, it may not be as precise, as there could be gaps in the ID sequence (e.g. if records were deleted), which could skew the distribution of selected records. In terms of efficiency, the second method is likely to be faster for large tables, but the first method may be more precise.
